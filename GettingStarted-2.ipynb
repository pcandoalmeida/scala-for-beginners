    "Functional Programming or FP is an approach to programming that aims to construct programs with only *pure functions*, which means functions that have no side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "That sounds perfectly fine. But what do we mean by *side effects*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Side effects can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Throwing an exception\n",
    "* Logging or printing something out to the console\n",
    "* Updating a variable\n",
    "* Updating or modifying a data structure like an array in place\n",

    "In this section, we will define the following two concepts:\n",

    "* Referential Transparency\n",
    "* Substituion Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Referential Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Transparency (RT) is the idea that the behaviour of a function is represented by the value that it returns. This leads to *equational reasoning* about programs. Computation proceeds by substituting equal expressions. This is why functions cannot have side effects. If they did, then a function would not be represented by just its return value. It would have a knock on effect onto other aspects of our program and thus makes it harder to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Substitution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution model therefore says that we can substitute a pieces of modular code (in this case, pure functions) together in order to achieve an end result."
