    "Functional Programming or FP is an approach to programming that aims to construct programs with only *pure functions*. This means functions that have no **side effects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds reasonable. But what do we mean by *side effects*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Side effects can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Throwing an **exception**\n",
    "* Logging or **printing** something out to the console\n",
    "* **Updating** a variable\n",
    "* Updating or **modifying** a data structure like an array **in place**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yikes! Doesn't that limit what our programs can do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not really. In fact, FP can introduce some improvements into our code as a result of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so what's imperative programming, again?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imperative programming** is one where instructions are laid out sequentially and processed top to bottom, using things like while loops, for-loops and often, mutable data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will define the following two concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Referential Transparency\n",
    "* Substituion Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Referential Transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential Transparency (RT) is the idea that the *behaviour of a function is represented by the value that it returns*. This leads to *equational reasoning* about programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computation proceeds by substituting equal expressions. This is why functions cannot have side effects. If they did, then a function would not be represented by just its return value. It would have a knock on effect onto other aspects of our program and thus makes it harder to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Substitution Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution model therefore says that we can substitute a pieces of modular code (in this case, pure functions) together in order to achieve an end result. This has particular advantages for computation. Take the following as an example of substitution:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For all e in the set of PositiveIntegers{e}:\n",
    "\n",
    "a + b + c == (a + b) + c == a + (b + c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this tight and considered control, the compiler can optimize instruction evaluation without having an impact on the overall outcome of the program. It could be the case that performing `(b + c)`  and then `a + (b + c)` leads to better performance than the other two possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "FP therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deals and works with pure functions\n",
    "* Uses immutable variables and data structures\n",
    "* Uses functions as the main unit of computation"
